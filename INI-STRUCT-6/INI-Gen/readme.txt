Here I am adding the final iteration of make INI Structures. The plan is to take position of natural INI a-keto acid head.
Then with that position I will align first carbon carbon bond (Exception for lig 7) that alignment will dictate tail position.
After that alignment the rotational and translational matrix will be applied to the rest of tail. 
This gives us a new INI guess structure based on natural intermediate step
